Maria was at her university attending a class. She was studying history. Maria usually drove her car to school, the car she owned was pretty old. It had been her first car. Mike constantly would advise her to get a new one like his. Maria refused to replace her car. The car had sentimental value. It was a gift from her parents when she graduated from high school. Maria's class had just ended, and she was now on her way back home.

To get to her car, Maria had to walk to the parking structure of her college. Maria paid for parking every semester, it was not the most inexpensive parking there was. Maria stayed a little bit after class to talk to her classmates about an assignment. Then she approached the professor to ask him a question. "Professor, when is this next assignment due?" she asked. "It is due next week on Monday," he answered. Maria thanked her professor, wished him well, and went on her way.

Maria's school was quite large. She had grown accustomed to walking up and down the aisles and hills. She needed one more year to finish. Maria planned to take a short break after graduation and work before she went back to finish her next degree. Maria was walking along the pathway of her school. The sun was blaring above her, making her start to sweat! Maria couldn't wait to get home and jump into her tub and take a nice, cool bath.

After ten minutes of walking, she reached the parking structure and found her car. She entered her car and tried to turn it on. The car did not start. She tried turning it on again. the car still didn't start. Maria was fear and had come to life. She was stranded at the school because her car had stopped working. Her only choice was to call Mike and ask him to pick her up. She grabbed her cell phone from her backpack and dialed Mike's number. The phone dialed and mike answered.
