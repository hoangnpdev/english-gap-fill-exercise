Mike: Oh, my god!

Everybody: Happy birthday, Mike!

(Mike looked around and saw all his friends wearing birthday hats.)

Mike: Whose idea was this? I'm looking at you, Maria.

Maria: I'm guilty. It was all my idea.

Mike: I told you not to, Maria. This was unnecessary. You guys did not have to go through all this trouble.

Doug: Are you kidding me, Mike? You're our best friend and a great guy. If anybody deserves a birthday party, it's you, buddy.

Mike: Thank you, Doug. And thank you everybody for being here. It really means a lot to me. Thank you, Maria, for arranging all this. You are everything a guy could ask for, and much more.

(Mike hugs Maria, and then everybody swoons at them)

Mike: Let's eat some cake!

Maria: I bought your favorite, chocolate cake.

Mike: You know me so well, Maria. Thank you.

Maria: Before we eat, we have to light the candle and sing Happy Birthday.


Mike: That's alright. I'm sure everybody just wants to eat some cake, already.

Maria: Mike, it's a tradition! You have to blow out the candles.

Doug: Come on, Mike, don't you want to make a wish?

(Mike agrees and Maria lights twenty-five candles on the cake.)

Maria: On the count of three, everybody starts singing Happy Birthday. One, two, happy birthday to you!

(Everybody joyously sings along and Mike blows out the candles.)

Maria: Did you make a wish?

Mike: Yes. But I can't tell you or else it won't come true.

Doug: You'd better have wished for a million dollars, Mike.

Mike: I wished for something better.

Doug: What could be better than a million dollars? Did you wish for two million dollars?

Mike: Better than that!

(Mike wished for him and Maria to stay together for the rest of their lives.)
