It was the thirty-first of October in the city of Pasadena. Mike and Maria were excited to be celebrating Halloween. Halloween is Mike's favorite holiday. Mike and Maria spent all day yesterday preparing to give out candy and decorating their apartment for their trick-or-treaters. Before doing so, Mike and Maria asked their landlord for permission.

They decorated their apartment exterior with fake spider webs, scary looking stuffed mannequins, and fake tombstones on their small front yard. They also used jack-o'-lanterns and got a fog machine. Mike tried his best to make their apartment exterior look scary. All that was left for them to do was to buy last minute costumes for themselves and candy for their trick-or-treaters.
