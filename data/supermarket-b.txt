Maria: I am so sorry! I didn't mean to! I was trying to find the potatoes.

Employee: Don't worry about it! They're in the first aisle next to the onions. If you need any more help, feel free to ask.

(The employee then walks away. For some reason, the employee looks very familiar to Maria. After a few seconds, Maria recognizes to the employee was. Maria walks up to the employee and taps her on the shoulder.)

Maria: Elizabeth? It's Maria. Remember me?

(The employee takes a quick look at Maria.)

Employee: hi, yes! I thought I recognized you! How are you? It has been such a long time!

Maria: Yes, it has! I haven't seen you since high school! I have been fine. How about you? I didn't know you worked here. Do you still live in the area?

Elizabeth: Yeah, I still do. I have been working here for about eight months now. I needed the job to help pay for my college loans.

Maria: Oh, I see. Are you still studying for a career in animation like you planned back in high school?


Elizabeth: I am, but I decided I also want to be an illustrator as well.

Maria: That sounds great! Are you excited?

Elizabeth: Yes, I am! It can be very competitive, though.

Maria: Are you worried about being successful?

Elizabeth: Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind not becoming a famous artist. Just as long as I can make people happy with my art and live off it at the same time. Even if I still have to work a part-time job, I will be satisfied.

Maria: That sounds lovely, Elizabeth. I'm sure you'll make lots of people happy.

Elizabeth: Well, I have to get back to work. It was nice seeing you again, Maria. I wish you luck in everything.

Maria: It was great seeing you, too. Have a nice day.

(After that, Maria found the potatoes she needed, bought her groceries, and headed home.)
