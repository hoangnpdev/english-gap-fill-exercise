A: Would you be able to pick me up at the airport next Sunday?

B: Sure, I would be happy to help you. What time are you arriving?

A: I will be arriving at 3:00 in the afternoon.

B: By the time you pick up your luggage, it will be around 3:30. What if I meet you outside at the curb?

A: That would be a good time to meet, but what if I am running late?

B: I can track your plane online. I can just put in the flight number and I can see if you are on time.

A: Can you make sure that you have your cell phone with you so I can call you?

B: Yes, that would be good idea.

A: If something happens and you can't make it, just let me know and I'll book a Super Shuttle.

B: Don't worry. I'll be able to pick you up.
