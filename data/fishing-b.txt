Henry: I'm so glad Maria's finally found someone to settle down with.

Mike: I'm honored that she chose me, out of all people.

Henry: Now don't say that. From what Maria's told me, you seem to be doing pretty well for yourself.

Mike: I try my best to support her. We're actually thinking of buying a house after the wedding.

Henry: Is that so? That sounds like a good idea. Are you two planning on staying in Pasadena?

Mike: We haven't really discussed where yet. Our options are open, though.


Henry: Why don't the two of you come live in San Diego?

Mike: That's something to consider. I'll bring it up to Maria the next time I get the chance.

Henry: Mike, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking good care of my little girl.

Mike: That seems to be a lot coming from you

Henry: I wish the two of you nothing but the best.

Mike: Thank you. Is there any advice you can lend a future husband?

Henry: Yes. Don't have any children!

(Mike and Henry share a good laugh as they fished away for the rest of the day.)
