Mike: Are you alright?

Maria: Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little scared. Are you okay?

Mike: Yes, I'm fine, too.

Maria: Did the tire pop, Mike?

Mike: I think it did. Stay in the car, Maria. I'm going to take a look at the tire.

Maria: I want to go with you, Mike.

Mike: Stay with Tiger. I'm not going anywhere far.

Maria: Alright, Mike. Be careful, please.

(Mike inspected all of the car's tires. One of the back tires was completely flat. He went back inside the car to talk to Maria.)

Mike: It's just as I expected. We have a flat tire, but don't worry.

Maria: A flat tire? How did that happen? What are we going to do, Mike? I hope we're not stranded on the road.

Mike: Maria, I told you. Don't worry about a thing. Everything is going to be alright. I have a spare tire in the back.

Maria: You could change the tire? Why don't we call for help?


Mike: That won't be necessary. We don't need any help. I could handle this. Trust me.

Maria: If you say so, Mike.

Mike: I'll have us out on the road in less than thirty minutes. Before you know it, we will be at home with our new little pet. Everything is going to be alright.

Maria: Are you sure you don't need any help?

Mike: I'm sure.

(Mike kisses Maria on the cheek and proceeds to change the tire. After twenty minutes, he successfully switches the tire with the new one. He goes back inside the car and turns it on.)

Mike: See, what did I tell you?

Maria: That was pretty scary. Is this the first time that has happened to you?

Mike: No. There's been at least three other times that I can remember.

(Mike and Maria safely drive to the market to buy the cat food and then safely arrive home.)
