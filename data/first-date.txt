It was six o'clock on a Friday night. 
Maria was getting ready for her date at seven. 
She expected him to be on time and could not afford to keep him waiting on account of her not being ready. 
It had been awhile since she had last been on date with a guy. She was feeling a little nervous. 
She looked at her herself in the mirror, and applied her makeup. She put on her favorite red dress and brushed her hair. 
It was important for her to look her best.
Mike, on the other hand, did a little preparing on his part. 
He showered, combed his hair, put on his shirt and jeans, and sprayed on some cologne. 
This process had taken him thirty minutes. Maria began getting ready at five. 
Mike was on his way to Maria's apartment to pick her up. He drove a fairly new black car. 
He had started financing it a few months ago. He had hoped the car would impress Maria.
Mike was about fifteen minutes away from Maria's apartment when he started thinking about what to say to her. 
He was not feeling nervous like Maria was. Mike had complete confidence in himself. Nothing could go wrong. Mike arrived at her address. He calls Maria on his cell phone. 
Maria tells him she will be out in a minute. 
Mike says okay, and steps out of his car to smoke a cigarette. Mike looks around the street. He spots a stranger walking towards his direction. 
The stranger looked like he had something on his mind. The stranger approaches Mike.
