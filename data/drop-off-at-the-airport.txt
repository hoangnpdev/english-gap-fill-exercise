A: Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow afternoon?

B: I would be happy to drive you to the airport. When do you need to leave?

A: For an international flight, the airline wants us to check in two hours in advance, so I need to leave my house at 2:00.

B: Do you have a lot of luggage to check in?

A: I am only carrying one large bag and a carry-on.

B: I'll bring our smaller car then. Do you know where you need to get dropped off?

A: Yes, I am flying out on Singapore Air to Sydney, so I need to be at the International Terminal.

B: Will I be able to come in with you to say goodbye?

A: Actually, with airport regulations being so strict, you should probably just drop me off at the curb.

B: That will work out fine. Just give me a call if anything changes.
