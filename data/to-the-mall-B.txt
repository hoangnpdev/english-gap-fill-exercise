Maria: Look at all those beautiful new clothes!

Mike: And look at how much they cost!

Maria: I want to buy everything in this store!

Mike: And we'd be broke by the end.

Maria: Mike, which shirt do you think complements my figure? This one or this one?

(Maria lifted up two different shirts to her neck to show Mike.)

Mike: Umm, I think they both look good.

Maria: You have to pick one!

Mike: Alright. I like the blue one.

Maria: Really? I prefer the red one.

Mike: That one looks nice as well.

(Mike looks bored.)

Maria: You don't want to look at any clothes for yourself?

Mike: No, I don't think I need any new clothes at the moment.

Maria: Are you sure? They have some nice jeans.

Mike: On second thought, I think I do need some new blue jeans.

Maria: There you go! That's the shopping spirit. I'll go with you to the men's pants section.

(Mike and Maria look at different brands of jeans. After some thought, Mike chooses two pairs of blue jeans.)

Mike: Okay, I think this is all that I will buy today.

Maria: I'm going to browse a little more if that's oaky with you.

Mike: Alright. I guess I'll just follow you until you decide to buy something.

Maria: Great! Here, you can hold my bag. This could take a while.
