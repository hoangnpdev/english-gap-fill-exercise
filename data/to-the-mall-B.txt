Maria: Look how many clothes there are!
Mike: And look at how much they cost!
Maria: I want to buy everything in this store!
Mike: We'd be broke by the end.
Maria: Mike, which shirt do you think complements my figure? This one or this one?
(Maria lifted up two different shirts to her neck to show Mike.)
Mike: Umm, I think they both look good.
Maria: You have to pick one!
Mike: Alright. I like the blue one.
Maria: Really? I like the red one instead.
Mike: That one looks nice as well.
Maria: You don't want to look at any clothes?
Mike: No, I don't think I need any new clothes at the moment.
Maria: Are you sure? They have some nice jeans.
Mike: On second thought, I think I do need some new blue jeans.
Maria: There you go! That's the shopping spirit. I'll go with you to the men's pants section.
(Mike and Maria look at different brands of jeans. After some thought, Mike got two pairs of blue jeans.)
Mike: Alright, I think this is all that I will buy today.
Maria: I'm going to browse a little more if that's okay with you.
Mike: Alright. I guess I'll trail you until you decide to buy something.
Maria: Great! Here you go, hold my bag. This could take a while.
