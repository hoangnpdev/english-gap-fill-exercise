Mike, Doug, and Maria were on their way to go bowling. There was a good bowling alley that Mike had read about in Pasadena. It was called Lucky Strike. Mike mentioned it to Maria and Doug. They both had no objections to the idea and agreed to go.

Doug asked if the bowling alley also served food. "I'm not sure if they do, Doug," Mike answered. Doug was feeling kind of hungry. "I guess we're just going to have to find out when we get there," Doug said. The bowling alley wasn't too far away from home. Mike, Doug, and Maria arrived shortly. Since it was a weekday, not too many people were at the bowling alley. Mike could tell by the parking lot that this was true. It was vacant of any cars. "I think we came at a good time, guys," Mike said to Maria and Doug.

They parked near the bowling alley and exited the car. The bowling alley seemed like it was not such a big place, judging from the outside,. Doug noticed this and made a comment. "Are you sure this is a bowling alley? It looks more like a small market to me," Doug said. "Wait until we get inside," Mike responded.

They walked in through the doors. Doug and Maria were surprised at how much bigger the inside of the building was compared to the outside. Doug especially was in disbelief. "Wow! You were not kidding, Mike," he said, looking around. Maria told Mike that she had to use the restroom. Mike pointed her to the direction of the restroom and Maria went. Doug was still hungry. Mike told Doug that the vending machine was around the corner. Doug went to the vending machine and bought some peanuts. As soon as everybody returned, they went up to the counter to buy their rounds of bowling.
