Maria: Good morning! How are you doing today, sir?
Mike: Fine, thank you. How are you?
(Mike smiled nice and big.)
Maria: A little sleepy, but I'm alright. Thank you for asking. What will it be for you today?
(Mike hesitated a little. He looked behind him to see if there was anyone else waiting in line. Luckily there was no one.)
Mike: Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mike Smith. What's your name?
(Mike reached his hand out to her. She looked at his hand, and then shook it cautiously. She was caught off guard.)
Maria: Hi, my name is Maria. Have I seen you before? You look awfully familiar.
Mike: I'm a regular at this coffee shop. I come here every morning before work. You really don't recognize me?
Maria: No, I'm so sorry. I see a lot of faces come and go every day. It's kind of hard to keep track of all of them.
Mike: That's alright. Don't feel bad. I understand.
Maria: Are you going to order anything, Mike? Or is there something else I could help you with?
Mike: I wanted to ask you a few questions, if that's alright?
(Maria smiled. She looked around to see if her boss was around. He was nowhere in sight.)
Maria: Sure.
Mike: How long have you been working here?
Maria: It'll be two years in October.
Mike: How do you like working here?
Maria: I don't mind. It's only part-time while I go to college.
Mike: You're going to school? That's great.
Maria: Why, thank you.
Mike: Listen, would you like to go out on a date so we could get to know each other a little more?
Maria: Um, sure. Why not?
Mike: Can I have your phone number?
Maria: It's 867-5309.
(Mike turned around and noticed there had been a line forming behind him.)
Mike: I'll call you soon. Thank you!
