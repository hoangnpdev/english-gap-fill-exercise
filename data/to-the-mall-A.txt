Maria was at home one afternoon sitting on the couch watching television. As she was watching her favorite reality show, a commercial suddenly came on. A woman's voice started talking about a clothing store located at the Pasadena mall. The commercial featured young people wearing trendy clothing and looking happy. Maria suddenly felt the urge to go shopping. The commercial had convinced her to go to the mall.
Maria called Mike, who had gone to the store to pick up some toothpaste and told him that she wanted to go to the mall. "Mike, can we go to the mall?" she asked him. Mike was in the restroom aisle at the store. He wondered why Maria had suddenly called him to ask if they could go to the mall. "Maria, did you see that popular commercial that's been airing on television?" he asked, curiously. Maria did not want to admit that she had indeed seen the television ad, so she denied it.
"No, I have not," she lied. Mike then asked why she suddenly wanted to go to the mall. "No particular reason. I think I need some new clothes," she lied again. "But you have more than enough clothes, Maria," Mike said to her. Maria begged Mike to go with her to the mall.
After much pleading, Mike finally conceded. "Alright, we'll go this weekend," he tiredly said. Maria was thrilled. "Thank you, Mike! You're the best, you know that?" she said. Mike agreed and said goodbye. The following Saturday, Mike took Maria to the mall where they went inside the clothing store from the commercial Maria had seen.
