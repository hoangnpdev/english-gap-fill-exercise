Maria: Hello, is this the landlord that is renting out the apartment in Pasadena?

Landlord: Which apartment are you talking about?

Maria: The one on Wilson Avenue.

Landlord: Oh, Wilson Avenue! Yes, this is the landlord renting out that apartment. How are you today? Can I answer any of your questions?

Maria: I'm fine, thank you. Yes, my boyfriend and I are interested in visiting the apartment this afternoon. Would this be possible?

Landlord: Absolutely! Come on down and see the place. It's a real nice apartment. It's perfect for a couple.

Maria: Okay, great! Can we come at three o'clock?

Landlord: You guys sure can. I'll be at the apartment waiting for your arrival.

Maria: Thank so much. We look forward to meeting you.

Landlord: Likewise. Goodbye.

Maria: Goodbye.

(Maria hangs up, and puts down the phone on the counter. Mike was sitting next to her. They were at his downtown apartment. Maria tells Mike the good news, and they begin getting ready to visit the apartment. A few hours later, they arrive at Wilson Avenue. Mike parks his car, and they both exit the vehicle. They make their way to the front steps of the apartment where the landlord sits waiting for them.)

Landlord: Howdy! Nice to meet you.

Mike: Hello, nice to meet you.

Maria: Hello.

(Greeting formalities are made, and hands are shaken.)
