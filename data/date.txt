A: Can I ask you a question?

B: Sure, what's up?

A: Well, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Friday.

B: Really?

A: Yeah, I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie.

B: That sounds like fun.

A: Of course, we can do something else if you'd like.

B: No, no, dinner and a movie sounds great.

A: Well, what time would you like me to pick you up?

B: How about 7:30?

A: That sounds good, so I'll see you then.

B: Okay, cool.
