It was a hot and windy day in the city of Pasadena. Mike and Maria were happy because they were starting their summer break. But their apartment felt stuffy, so they went out for a walk trying to cool off from the humidity. After a few blocks, Mike and Maria came across an ice cream parlor and decided to go in and enjoy a few scoops. Mike bought two scoops of coconut ice cream. Maria chose two scoops of mint chocolate chip ice cream.


After their walk, Mike and Maria headed back to their apartment. While inside, Maria got busy at the kitchen table writing a list of things she wanted to do during their break. Mike sat down on the couch in the living room and began to watch television.

While Maria wrote down ideas, Mike offered her a few suggestions of his own. Suddenly, Mike had the idea that it would be nice to kick things off with a day at the beach. Maria quickly agreed and thought it was a great way to start the summer as well.
