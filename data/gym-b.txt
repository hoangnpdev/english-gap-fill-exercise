Trainer: Good morning. What can I do for you two today?

Maria: We would like to buy a membership.

Trainer: Alright. A gym membership just for two people?

Maria: Yes, please.

Trainer: Would you like to get a trainer to help you reach your personal health goals as well?

Mike: No, thank you. We'll just get the membership for right now.

Maria: Maybe later on.

Trainer: Alright, not a problem. Please fill out these forms, and we'll get you two started in no time.

(Mike and Maria fill out the proper forms.)

Mike: Are you sure you're ready to make this commitment, Maria? We're signing a contract for a whole year!

Maria: Yes, Mike. I want to start exercising.

Mike: I hope you don't change your mind.

(Mike and Maria turn in the forms and pay for their membership.)


Trainer: Thank you very much. You two are now welcome to use the equipment any time, twenty-four hours a day.

Maria: Great! Let's go run on the treadmills!

(Mike isn't so excited.)

Mike: Yeah, terrific. I guess let's do this.

Maria: We'll run for fifteen minutes as a warm-up.

Mike: I'll follow your lead.

(Mike and Maria run for fifteen minutes. They step off the machine both sweating and gasping for air.)

Mike: I can't breathe, Maria!

Maria: Don't be a wimp, Mike! Hang in there. We're just getting started.

Mike: Can we just a take a break for ten minutes. I can't remember the last time I ran for that long.

Maria: Alright, we'll take a break. But just for ten minutes. Then we'll start working on our upper bodies.

Mike: How often are we going to do this?

Maria: At least three times a week.

Mike: I hope I don't collapse!

(Maria gives him one of those looks. Mike knows he'll be getting into better shape, whether he likes it or not.)
