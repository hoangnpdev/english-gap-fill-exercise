Theodore: Mike, you're soaked in rain. What happened to you?

Mike: I'm locked out of my apartment. Achoo!

(Mike sneezes.)

Theodore: You're also sick? You chose a bad time to get caught in the rain. Where did you lose your keys?

Mike: I have no clue. I had them with me when I left to work in the morning.

Theodore: You most likely left them at your job. That seems to be the only explanation.

Mike: You're probably right. How could I forget the keys to my own apartment?

Theodore: There is no point in feeling bad about it. There's nothing you can do about it.

Mike: You're right, Theodore.

Theodore: You can call me Theo if you want. That's what my friends call me.

(Mike gives a grin.)

Mike: Theo, do you have some dry clothes I can change into?

Theodore: Let me go look in my closet. I'll be back in a second.

(Theodore soon came back with some clothes and a towel.)


Theodore: I found some of the clothes I used to wear when I was younger man. I hope it fits you. Let me show you where the restroom is. You can change in there.

(Mike dries himself and puts the dry clothes on.)

Mike: Thanks, Theo. I appreciate it.

(Mike sneezes again.)

Theodore: You must have a cold. Let me fix you something hot to drink. You can take a seat in the living room in the meantime.

Mike: Thank you, Theo. You are too kind.

(Mike sits down on a chair and waits for Theodore.)

Theodore: Here you go, Mike. I made some hot chocolate for you.

Mike: Thank you.

Theodore: Where's Maria?

Mike: She's on her way home from school. She should be arriving in a minute.

(Mike and Theodore continue to talk until Maria came back home.)
