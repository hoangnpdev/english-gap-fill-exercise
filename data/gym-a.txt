Maria was a fairly skinny girl. Mike was of average weight as well. Lately, Maria had begun to notice her weight. It all started when Maria went to the restroom and looked at herself in the mirror. She looked down at her stomach and felt a little self-conscious on how it looked. She rubbed her belly with her hands and thought that it had grown a bit bigger. She needed a second opinion. "Mike! Can you please come to the restroom?" she called. Mike walked in after a few minutes with a can of soda in his hand. "What is it, Maria?" he asked.


Maria turned her body towards him and lifted her shirt to reveal her stomach. "Be honest. Do you think I've gained weight?" she asked sincerely. Mike widened his eyes and hesitated to respond right away. Maria didn't like that he did that. "Maria, you look perfectly fine to me," he said after a few seconds. Maria was not satisfied with his answer. "Why did you take so long to answer the question?" Maria asked. Mike told her that the question had caught him off guard. Maria then told Mike of her concern about her weight.

"Mike, I think we need to start going to a gym to exercise," Maria said. Mike looked down at his body and realized that going to gym was perhaps not such a bad idea. "Alright, maybe we're not in the best shape of our lives. But at least we're happy" Mike said to Maria.

Maria then lectured Mike on the importance of health and longevity. Mike agreed to start going to a gym after Maria's lecture. The next day, Mike and Maria left bright and early to a gym to buy a membership. They entered the gym and were greeted by a personal trainer.
